# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis
### Objective
A sequenced cancer tumour can have thousands of genetic mutations . Our objective is to distinguish between the mutations that can lead to tumours and the meutral mutations.
From genes and their variations , we can classify them into 9 classes , some of these classes can lead to cancer tumours.
